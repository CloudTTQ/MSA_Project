# DOC SOS 
## MSA PROJECT
## _Problem_:  In some cases, elderly people cannot get to the doctor. This could be due to:

- Difficulty walking or limited mobility
- Taking a long time to move due to age-related conditions
- Additionally, those who are wheelchair-bound or bedridden face similar challenges.

## _Solution_: An easy to use app that would make the communication between the patient and the doctor seemless

## _Target Audience_
 - Elderly people aged 50+ who cannot get to the doctor due to mobility issues or health constraints.
 - People with certain handicaps that make it more difficult to get to the doctors clinic

## FAQ

#### Q: But if I want to use a video chat app to talk to patients, isn’t that just as good?

Elderly people may not be inclined to use popular apps, either because they don’t know how to use them or find them confusing. This app is designed with a simple UI and UX tailored for elderly users, making it easy for them to navigate.

#### Q: But I can text my doctor every day and he responds to me.

This might work for some, but not everyone has this level of access. Doctors might receive messages across multiple platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook, SMS, etc.), which can lead to missed messages. Additionally, doctors often have policies limiting communication outside of work hours. Our app provides a dedicated, centralized communication channel to reduce these issues.
